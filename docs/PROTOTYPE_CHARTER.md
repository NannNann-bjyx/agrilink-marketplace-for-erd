# AgriLink – Prototype Charter

Version: 1.0  
Date: January 2025  
Sponsor: Myanmar stakeholder (evaluation partner)  
Team: AgriLink Project Team

---

## 1) Purpose
Validate desirability, usability, and viability of AgriLink's core marketplace flows with a limited cohort, to inform a post‑prototype go/no‑go and Phase‑2 scope.

## 2) Prototype Scope (MVP)
- User registration/login (Buyer, Farmer, Trader, Admin)
- Product listing and discovery (search + basic filters)
- Messaging (product‑specific conversations)
- Offer creation and response
- Basic admin verification and dashboards

Out of scope: payments, mobile app, advanced analytics, bulk ops (moved to post‑prototype roadmap).

## 3) Objectives & KPIs
- Adoption: 50–150 total prototype users onboarded
- Activity: 50–150 offers created; 20–50 completed
- Satisfaction: NPS ≥ 40; task success ≥ 80% for core flows
- Trust: ≥ 40–60% of active users verified (lightweight)
- Price clarity: ≥ 70% report improved price visibility

## 4) Deliverables
- Deployed MVP (Vercel) + seeded data
- Prototype user onboarding guide + FAQs
- Metrics snapshot and usability findings
- Post‑prototype recommendations and Phase‑2 plan

## 5) Timeline (8–12 weeks)
- Weeks 1–2: Discovery & design sign‑off
- Weeks 3–6: MVP build (core flows)
- Weeks 7–8: Testing + prototype onboarding
- Weeks 9–10: Prototype run & support
- Weeks 11–12: Evaluation & roadmap

## 6) Roles & Responsibilities
- Sponsor (Myanmar): Feedback, prototype access, cohort facilitation
- Product/PM: Scope, prioritization, timeline, stakeholder sync
- Engineering: Build, deploy, stabilize MVP
- QA/UX: Test plans, usability sessions, findings
- Support: Prototype user onboarding and issue triage

## 7) Risks & Mitigations
- Ambiguous requirements → Weekly scope reviews; freeze MVP early
- Time‑boxed delivery → Strict prioritization; defer non‑critical work
- Low adoption → Sponsor‑assisted recruitment; simple onboarding
- Infra/3rd‑party issues → Fallbacks; clear support playbook

## 8) Exit Criteria & Next Steps
Exit Criteria (all true):
- MVP deployed and used by real prototype users
- KPIs collected; ≥ 3–5 case studies documented
- Critical bugs resolved; core flows stable

Next Steps:
- If KPIs met: plan Phase‑2 (payments, analytics, mobile)
- If partial: iterate on UX, narrow scope, extend prototype
- If unmet: document learnings and pivot recommendations

This charter guides a focused, time‑boxed prototype to generate credible evidence for Phase‑2 decisions.
